            </p>

            <p>
                In recent years there has been much interest in the care of Rare Diseases, and
                it has received significant backing. In 2009 the EU called for the development
                of strategies for the treatment of rare disease. In the UK, Rare Disease UK
                (www.raredisease.org.uk) has been developed, principally by the Genetic Interest
                Group and partners, with a clear mandate to develop a coherent strategy for
                prevention, diagnosis, treatment, research into and information sharing about,
                rare diseases. Furthermore, the MRC with NIHR developed the ‘Patient Research
                Cohort Initiative’, funding projects facilitating development of cohorts for the
                purpose of research.
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the projects to receive funding from the MRC was RaDaR. This rare kidney
                disease registry has the backing of the Renal Association and the BAPN and is
                designed to develop cohorts of patients with rare renal disease to facilitate
                translational and epidemiological research into rare kidney diseases by setting
                up and maintaining comprehensive clinical databases in partnership with
                disease-specific research groups.
            </p>

            <p>
                This initiative is now underway. The two pilot projects are, studies in Steroid
                Resistant Nephrotic Syndrome in Childhood (Bristol) and MPGN (Birmingham). The
                data will be collected on this web-based database under the remit of RaDaR which
                is managed by the UK Renal Registry and governed by the Renal Association.
            </p>

            <p>
                The five year plan for RaDaR is to complete the two pilot projects with
                presentation of the data/results but also to encourage further studies.
                Individuals or Centres will be encouraged to form a disease specific research
                group, present a proposal for a project to the RaDaR committee and develop
                specific data collection fields for the database.

            <p>
                A study to correlate the epidemiological and clinical features of Steroid
                Resistance Nephrotic Syndrome including FSGS (Focal Segmental
                GlomeruloSclerosis) in childhood, in the UK, with genotype and to develop
                biomarkers of disease activity post transplantation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Initially the project was designed to focus on FSGS, however, in order to be
                more inclusive and with the advent of a European Registry of Nephrotic Syndrome
                it seemed prudent to encompass all steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome at this
                time which might allow for easier collaboration at a later date.
            </p>

            <p>
                Rather than a leading hypothesis, the central aims of this study are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        To identify and develop a cohort of children in the UK with SRNS and to perform
                        gene analysis of the genes currently known to cause nephrotic syndrome in
                        childhood.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>
                        To provide a comprehensive genotype/phenotype correlation of the disease, in a
                        substantial cohort of patients.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        To answer the question of whether and to what degree post-transplant recurrence
                        of FSGS is a heterogeneous disease, seen at the level of the cellular response.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        To provide the basis for a predictive in vitro test for patients who will suffer
                        recurrence of the disease post-transplantation
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                &nbsp;The project will utilise data collected by RaDaR on every child in the UK with
                SRNS and analyse it for patterns, particularly clinical parameters on diagnosis
                that may predict future outcome. Each patient consented will be tested for the
                gene mutations currently known to cause FSGS in childhood (these are described
                in detail under the gene analysis heading). Those patients who undergo
                transplantation will have blood and urine samples taken pre and post operatively
                to look for biomarkers of disease and their correlation to disease recurrence
                post transplantation. Finally, for those patients who suffer disease recurrence
                post transplantation and undergo plasma exchange, samples of plasma will be
                taken whilst in disease recurrence and then again in remission to compare for
                the presence of biomarkers of disease. The gene analysis data will be fed back
                to the lead clinician for the patient. The results for the other components of
                the study will be assimilated and presented in meetings or peer reviewed
                journals.

        <p style="font-weight: 700">Gene Analysis

        </p>

        <p>
            The purpose of this component of the project is to identify, in a large
            unselected cohort, the prevalence of gene mutations that may be associated with
            childhood SRNS. Although there are seven genes described in the patient
            information sheets that have so far been identified, it is envisaged that there
            will be others that are identified later. The consent has been specifically
            written so that the samples can be utilised at a later date to test for any new
            genes.
        </p>

        <p>
            The gene analysis will be carried out in the Academic Renal Unit in Bristol. DNA
            will be extracted from the patient’s blood sample and undergo PCR for each exon
            in each gene. These will then be sent away for sequencing to identify mutations.
            It may be that in the future the research group will collaborate with others or
            employ other techniques to speed up the process.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is expected that approximately 20-25% of sporadic cases of childhood FSGS
            will have an identifiable gene mutation with the majority of these podocin
            mutations. However in SRNS as a whole it is expected that this number may be
            less in those above the age of two at onset. However this is an exciting
            opportunity to test a large cohort of patients to tell us more about prevalence
            of these gene abnormalities in the UK population. It also affords the
            opportunity to look for heterozygous sequence variants and digenic inheritance
            (2 separate genes affected) in greater detail.
        </p>

        <p><b>Nephrin (NPHS1)</b>
            <br>
            Located on locus 19q31. It spans 26kb and has 29 exons. It was first discovered
            by Kestila in 1998 during the investigation of Finnish type congenital nephrotic
            syndrome [1]. It is a trans-membrane protein of the immunoglobulin family of
            cell adhesion molecules found exclusively in the podocyte. It is a major player
            in the slit diaphragm with multiple functions including organisation of the
            cytoskeleton, signalling, determining podocyte polarity and podocyte
            development. Although mostly recognised in its association with CNS, Nephrin
            mutations have been found in older children with SRNS. Initially in tri-allelic
            hits [2], in 2008 a French group described mutations in 10 children with SRNS in
            whom Podocin mutations were negative. All were steroid resistant and had a
            protracted course, averaging 13.6years from disease onset to end stage renal
            failure [3].

        <p>
            <b>Podocin (NPHS2)</b>
            <br>
            Located on locus 1q25-q31. It has 8 exons. Boute first described this gene in
            2000 using positional cloning in families with AR childhood FSGS [1]. In fact
            this has proved to be the most common gene causing FSGS, both familial and
            sporadic. Podocin is a podocyte specific protein which interacts with nephrin
            (and CD2AP) to enhance its signalling and mutations affect Podocin and Nephrin
            recruitment to the slit diaphragm. Typically children with this mutation show no
            response to immunosuppression and were thought not to suffer disease recurrence
            post transplantation. However, there are now reported cases of disease
            recurrence [2]. There is some suggestion that risk of recurrence correlates to
            type of mutation [3], but a lot more information is needed before these
            questions can be definitively answered.

        <p><b>PLCε1 (or NPHS3)</b>
            <br>
            Located on locus 10q23. It spans 334.4kb and has 34 exons. Not exclusive to the
            glomeruli it is involved in intracellular signalling and regulating Calcium
            influx. It was identified as a causative mutation in early onset SRNS in 2006 by
            positional cloning of both sporadic and non-sporadic forms. In those with
            truncating mutations phenotype was DMS, in those with non-truncating mutations,
            phenotype was FSGS [1]. A small proportion of the cohort appeared to respond to
            immunosuppression, and this needs to be tested in a larger population. In the
            podocyte PLCe1 is located in the podocyte cell bodies and the foot processes. It
            appears to interact with nephrin and the slit diaphragm proteins. In its
            absence, nephrin and podocin are down-regulated and development is impeded.
            However it is worth noting that in recent study, testing a large cohort of
            patients (adults and children) with FSGS, it was not identified [2].

            <b>CD2AP</b>
            <br>
            Located on locus 6p12. It has 17 exons. It is found in all organs except the
            brain. CD2AP is closely linked in the slit diaphragm with the other proteins,
            nephrin and podocin and connects to the actin cytoskeleton. It was identified as
            a causative gene mutation in two adults with FSGS in 2003 and a child with
            infantile FSGS in 2007 [1, 2]. More recently 3 children with sporadic FSGS and
            heterozygous mutations have been reported with associated down-regulation of
            slit diaphragm proteins [3]. CD2AP is clearly involved in the slit diaphragm and
            there are animal models which have severe renal phenotypes, however human
            phenotypes are not well described.

            expressed widely, but especially in the podocyte where it interacts with the
            other slit diaphragm proteins and is involved with maintaining cytoskeleton and
            also cell motility and adhesion. Using positional cloning it was first
            identified in three families with autosomal dominant FSGS with adolescent or
            adult onset [1]. More recently it has been identified in sporadic FSGS and
            childhood onset familial FSGS [2, 3].

            <br>
            Located on locus 11p13. It spans 50kb and has 10 exons. It is a transcription
            factor (affecting expression of genes in the cell nucleus) that was identified
            as a candidate gene for the Wilms Tumour by positional cloning and is known also
            to cause Denys Drash Syndrome and Frasier Syndrome with associated Diffuse
            Mesangial Sclerosis and FSGS respectively. In the latter syndrome, phenotypic
            females may be genotypically male (male pseudohermaphroditism), so it is
            important to karyotype all females with FSGS. Interestingly, it has also been
            shown to cause sporadic, isolated childhood SRNS (FSGS on histology) with an
            incidence of nearly 4% in previously tested cohorts [1, 2]. This includes girls
            with chromosomes 46XX. Typically the associated phenotype is of early onset,
            steroid resistance, rapid progression to ESRD but no recurrence post transplant
            [3].

            <b>TRPC6</b>
            <br>
            Located on locus 11q21-q22. It has 13 exons. It is a member of the transient
            receptor potential super family and is a calcium ion channel which associates
            with the slit diaphragm proteins and interacts directly with nephrin and
            podocin. Mutations are often gain of function nephrin mutations cause an up
            regulation of expression. TRPC6 is also a mechanosensor and may translate
            mechanical tension to ion channel action [1]. In 1999, analysis of a large
            kindred in New Zealand with autosomal dominant FSGS, revealed TRPC6 as the
            causative mutation [2]. This was subsequently confirmed in five other families
            with adult onset (age 17-57) autosomal dominant FSGS with variable progression
            to ESRD [3]. However, a recent study from Spain looking at a cohort of patients
            with FSGS, mainly sporadic, identified one child with a missense mutation who
            had not responded to steroids but had no other immunosuppression [4].

            <p>Developing biomarkers of disease

            </p>

            <p>
                The third part of this project aims to authenticate three potential biomarkers
                of disease recurrence post transplantation that the research team in Bristol
                have developed. Ideally, a disease biomarker is sensitive and specific, but also
                easy to perform and reproducible giving a useful guide to disease activity. The
                work in Bristol has utilised the human conditionally immortalised podocyte cell
                line.

                        &nbsp;Firstly, the slit diaphragm proteins relocate in response to exposure to
                        ‘disease’ or relapse plasma. Nephrin, podocin and CD2AP demonstrate a
                        cytoplasmic distribution in podocytes exposed to nephrotic plasma whereas after
                        exposure to non-nephrotic plasma they demonstrate a cortical distribution [1].

                    <p>
                        Secondly, control of TRPC6 channels in the slit diaphragm appears to be
                        important with the knowledge that mutations causing an increased function result
                        in FSGS. Also, wild-type TRPC6 is seen to be induced in other glomerular
                        diseases and TRPC6 activation is known to affect actin cytoskeleton
                        rearrangement [2]. The research team have developed a marker of TRPC6 activation
                        and will use this tool to investigate patient plasma in relapse and remission
                        [3].

                    <p>
                        Lastly, utilising a phosphoprotein micro array, the team identified proteins
                        that were phosphorylated in response to exposure to relapse plasma compared to
                        remission plasma linking signalling pathways to remodelling of the actin
                        cytoskeleton. The research team have identified that this is a consistent
                        finding in all patients tested so far (unpublished work).

            <p style="font-weight: 700">Circulating factor theory

            </p>

            <p>
                In 1974 Robert Shalhoub was the first to postulate on the theory of a
                circulating factor inducing nephrosis in NS. He postulated that abnormal T-cell
                function resulted in the secretion of a ‘circulating chemical mediator’, which
                was toxic to the Glomerular Basement Membrane (GBM) [1].
            </p>

            <p>
                The circulating theory is reinforced clinically by: the high risk of disease
                recurrence post transplant; the reduction in proteinuria following plasma
                exchange in post transplant recurrence and the in-vitro finding that disease
                plasma induces nephrotic changes in cultured podocytes.
            </p>

            <p>
                Virginia Savin and team from Wisconsin, in 1992 described an in-vitro bioassay
                to measure an increase in albumin permeability of isolated rat glomeruli which
                allowed for measurement of the change in permeability according to the
                environment that the glomeruli was exposed to [2]. They have since shown that
                plasma extracted from a series of patients in relapse of FSGS increased the
                permeability of the glomeruli compared to normal plasma [3]. This group has also
                worked on identifying the potential circulating factor describing a protein
                which 30-50kDa in size and heat and protease sensitive [3]. However it has
                proved difficult to isolate the factor and the permeability assay has also
                proved difficult to replicate in other laboratories. Also, the presence of the
                factor does not correlate with degree of proteinuria and presence pre
                transplantation did not correlate to recurrence risk post transplantation [4].
            </p>

            <p>
                Because of these difficulties it is probable that there is some other mechanism
                involved. One other associated theory is that in disease plasma there may be a
                factor missing or inhibited.
            </p>

            <p>
                In support of this, it has been shown that the increase in permeability that
                glomeruli demonstrate in vitro on exposure to disease plasma can be prevented by
                exposure to normal plasma just prior. Also, exposing cells to fetal calf serum
                compared to normal plasma also induced nephrotic changes [5]. Furthermore, one
                group demonstrated that plasma from children with Podocin mutations (and
                therefore not a circulating factor) also caused increased permeability in
                isolated glomeruli. Interestingly this effect was negated by addition of
                homologous urine (but not control urine). However, it is not possible to say if
                this loss of factor is a secondary or primary effect [6].

            </p>

            <p>
                Pierre Cochat’s group in Paris performed this retrospective study looking at
                outcome in SRNS. 78 patients in 8 centres were followed for between 1-20 years.
                They found patients were treated with a variety of strategies reflecting local
                preference and changes with time. During the follow-up period six patients
                developed deep vein thrombosis and 24 were admitted to hospital with an
                infection. Actuarial patient survival was 97% and renal survival at 5yrs, 10yrs
                and 15yrs was 75%, 58% and 53% respectively. The only clinical parameter on
                initial presentation which independently correlated with outcome was age with
                age below 10yrs at diagnosis beneficial (p&lt;0.001). 20 patients received
                transplants with 10 developing disease recurrence. 7 patients lost their graft
                in total with 4 due to disease recurrence.
