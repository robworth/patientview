<p class="header">Secure Passwords</p>

<p>Simple words or numbers are easy for machines or people to guess. Avoiding this is particularly important for
  passwords. Here are some simple ways to make it more difficult.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Don't make your password easy to guess, so not less than 6 characters and not 123456 or 777777, and certainly
    don't use
    "password"! It is safer to avoid other simple words (e.g. daffodil) too.
  </li>
  <li>Using a mixture of numbers and letters makes it much safer, e.g. daff271odil (daffodil 271)</li>
  <li>Using a mixture of capitals and ordinary letters is even better, e.g. dAff271oDil - this would be a very
    difficult password to guess, and not impossible to remember.
  </li>
  <li>Changing your password from time to time is wise. Certainly do that if you think that someone else may know
    yours.
  </li>
  <li>Most systems, including My IBD Portal, allow just letters and numbers in passwords, not spaces or special characters or
    punctuation such as ! - &pound; @ _ -,.
  </li>
</ol>
