            <p><b>Email Verification Failed</b></p>
        </div>

          <p>The verification of your email failed. This is because:</p>
<ul>
    <li>More than two weeks have passed since the verification email was sent - request a new verification.</li>
    <li>The email address on the verification doesn't match the current email address on your profile - perhaps you changed your email address again?</li>
    <li>The verification code doesn't match any verification requests - make a new verification request.</li>
</ul>
