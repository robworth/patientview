cautionary.letters=Letters are only shown where they can be retrieved from your renal unit's computer system.  This is not always possible, or it may not have been activated for your unit.  It is important to note that letters may be shown here before they have been finally approved and had mistakes corrected.

If you have any concerns you should discuss it at your next clinic appointment, or contact the author of the letter.
cautionary.medicines=This is a list of medicines as recorded on your renal unit's computer system.  IMPORTANT - the list of medicines shown here may not be complete or accurate, because  (1) Some renal units do not keep full records of medicines for all patients.  (2) Any changes made outside the renal unit - for example any new changes made, or new medicines prescribed by your GP or someone else, will not be shown here.  Please point out changes when you next attend a clinic appointment, or send a note or message to your renal unit.
